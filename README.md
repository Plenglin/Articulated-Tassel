# Servomechanism Congratulatory Articulation Augmentation for Tassels

The Servomechanism Congratulatory Augmentation Attachment for Tassels (SCAAT) is a direct functional augmentation for 240mm mortarboard hats that expands the capability of said hat to allow the gyration of the tassel along an an arbitrary axis on the user's sagittal plane. 

**In layman's terms, it makes your graduation cap's tassel spin like a f\*\*ing helicopter.**

Such a device does not exist within the class of modifications to mortarboards known as _decorations_. According to Merriam-Webster's dictionary, a decoration is:

## decoration

**noun.** dec·​o·​ra·​tion | \\de-kə-ˈrā-shən\\

1. the act or process of decorating
2. something that adorns, enriches, or beautifies : ORNAMENT
3. a badge of honor (such as a U.S. military award)

The SCAAT does not constitute a process nor act. It does not adorn, enrich, or beautify the cap in any sense, either, since acknowledging that it does would acknowledge that its creator, Maxim Yu, has a sense of aesthetic. It is not a badge of honor, but a badge of disappointed acknowledgement -- acknowledgement that SCAATs are, unfortunately, devices that are not available to all graduating seniors. Therefore, it would be wrong to classify it as a decoration.

The SCAAT provides additional functionality to the existing cap, which is why it is more accurately classified as a functional augmentation. Any attempts to classify it otherwise would not be acknowledging its true nature.

_Praise the SCAAT, for it delivereth us_ `extra functionality`. _We are bathed in the SCAAT's holy_ `gyration`. _We curse the heretics who decry its name and nature, misclassifying it as a_ `decoration`. _We do stanneth the believers who name it a_ `functional augmentation`.
